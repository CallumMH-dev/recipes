    <h3>Healthy potato-leak soup for vegetarians</h3>
    <p><strong><em>simple, straight-to-the-point and genuine.</em></strong></p>
    <ul><h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>2 leeks, chopped</li>
        <li>1 (32 fluid ounce) container vegetable broth</li>
        <li>1 ¾ cups water</li>
        <li>2 pounds potatoes, cut into cubes</li>
        <li>⅜ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <ol><h4>Steps</h4>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a stock pot over medium heat. Cook and stir leeks in hot oil until completely softened, adding remaining olive oil in small amounts as you cook the leeks, about 10 minutes. </li>
        <li>Pour vegetable broth and water into the pot; add potatoes. Bring mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer until the potatoes are completely tender, about 25 minutes. </li>
        <li>Pour potato mixture into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth. Stir cayenne pepper and salt into the soup. </li>
